# Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation💡

This repository contains a simplified implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) using PyTorch. The Vision Transformer is a novel architecture for image classification tasks, introduced by the paper:

**[An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)**  

## **Overview**✔️

The Vision Transformer (ViT) applies the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing, to image data. Instead of using convolutional layers, the image is divided into small patches, which are then treated as sequences of tokens for the transformer.

Key features of the ViT architecture:
- Splits the input image into fixed-size patches.
- Embeds these patches into a linear embedding space.
- Uses transformer layers to learn relationships between patches.
- Outputs class predictions using a fully connected layer.

## **How to Use**✔️

### ✅Clone the Repository

### ✅Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required packages

### ✅Train the Model
The training and evaluation script is in main.py. Customize the training parameters inside the script and run: python main.py

### ✅Dataset
The code is designed to work with any image classification dataset. You can modify the dataset loading logic in dataset.py to suit your dataset.

For example, you can use CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.

### ✅Results
The Vision Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on many image classification benchmarks when pre-trained on large-scale datasets and fine-tuned on specific tasks.

### ✅Future Work
Add pre-trained weights support for transfer learning.
Implement data augmentation techniques like Mixup and CutMix.
Extend the implementation to support object detection tasks.
